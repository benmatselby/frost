## Requirements

If you are wanting to build and develop this, you will need the following items installed. If, however, you just want to run the application I recommend using the docker container (See below)

- Go version 1.11+

## Configuration

You will need the following environment variables defining depending on which services you want to use:

```shell
export AZURE_DEVOPS_ACCOUNT=""
export AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT=""
export AZURE_DEVOPS_TOKEN=""

export TRAVIS_CI_OWNER=""
export TRAVIS_CI_TOKEN=""

export JENKINS_URL=""
export JENKINS_USERNAME=""
export JENKINS_PASSWORD=""
# This is only required, if you want to get an overview of Jenkins from a defined "view".
# If this is not specified, it gets all jobs
export JENKINS_VIEW=""
```

You can also define ~/.frost/config.yml which has various settings.

## Installation via Git

```shell
git clone git@github.com:benmatselby/frost.git
cd frost
make all
./frost --help
```

## Installation via Docker

Other than requiring [docker](http://docker.com) to be installed, there are no other requirements to run the application this way

```shell
$ docker run \
    --rm \
    -t \
    -eAZURE_DEVOPS_ACCOUNT \
    -eAZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT \
    -eAZURE_DEVOPS_TOKEN \
    -eTRAVIS_CI_OWNER \
    -eTRAVIS_CI_TOKEN \
    -eJENKINS_URL \
    -eJENKINS_USERNAME \
    -eJENKINS_PASSWORD \
    benmatselby/frost "$@"
```

## Bash completion

If you would like bash completion support, then run:

```shell
frost completion
```

This will generate a bash completion script in `/tmp/frost.sh`. You simply need to move this into your `bash_completion.d` folder. On the Mac, this is likely to be `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/`.
